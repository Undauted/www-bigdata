> Another trait, it took me a while to notice. I noticed the following
> facts about people who work with the door open or the door closed. I
> notice that if you have the door to your office closed, you get more
> work done today and tomorrow, and you are more productive than
> most. But 10 years later somehow you don't know quite know what
> problems are worth working on; all the hard work you do is sort of
> tangential in importance. He who works with the door open gets all
> kinds of interruptions, but he also occasionally gets clues as to what
> the world is and what might be important. Now I cannot prove the cause
> and effect sequence because you might say, “The closed door is
> symbolic of a closed mind.” I don't know. But I can say there is a
> pretty good correlation between those who work with the doors open and
> those who ultimately do important things, **although people who work
> with doors closed often work harder. Somehow they seem to work on
> slightly the wrong thing** – not much, but enough that they miss fame.<br>
